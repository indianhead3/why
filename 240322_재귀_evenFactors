//Write a static recursive method evenFactors that takes as input two positive integers and
//prints the even factors of the first integer that are greater than or equal to the second
//integer. For example, evenFactors(18,1) prints 2, 6, and 18, since the even factors of 18
//that are greater than or equal to 1 are 2,6, and 18.
